# Enhanced-Hate-Speech-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression-on-Balanced-Multi-Dataset-Corpus
This project aims to build an AI-powered text classification model that detects and categorizes online content as Hate Speech, Offensive, or Neutral. Using Logistic Regression trained on a balanced multi-dataset corpus, the model addresses data imbalance and improves fairness and accuracy across diverse linguistic patterns.

⚙️ Key Features

🧩 Multi-Dataset Integration – Combines multiple public hate speech datasets for better generalization.

⚖️ Data Balancing – Implements SMOTE and undersampling to handle class imbalance.

🧹 Advanced Preprocessing – Includes text cleaning, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.

📈 Improved Performance – Achieves higher Precision, Recall, and F1-score compared to traditional unbalanced models.

💬 Explainable Predictions – Uses probability-based confidence scores for each class.

🧪 Technologies Used
